          Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Remind me to thank John
          for a lovely weekend. Do you have any idea how long it takes those
          cups to decompose. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Yeah, but your
          scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they
          didn't stop to think if they should.
        </p>

          I was part of something special. Hey, take a look at the earthlings.
          Goodbye! God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Hey, take a
          look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Eventually, you do plan to have
          dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? You're a very talented young
          man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?
        </p>
        <p>
          Checkmate... Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the
          planet? Here's my chance. You really think you can fly that thing?
          Yes, Yes, without the oops! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really
          exist? Life finds a way. You really think you can fly that thing?
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, Yes, without the oops! Do you have any idea how long it takes
          those cups to decompose. They're using our own satellites against us.
          And the clock is ticking. God help us, we're in the hands of
          engineers. Checkmate... Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied
          with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they
          should.
